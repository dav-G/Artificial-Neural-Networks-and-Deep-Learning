- [`ensemble_learning.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_1/ensemble_learning.ipynb) performs the Model Average Ensemble
- [`model.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_1/model.ipynb) builds the model, by performing fine-tuning and implementing the optimization techniques discussed in the report

## Challenges
In the challenges we have the opportunity to test what we learned during the course. \
They are hosted on the CodaLab platform (https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/).

## Challenge 1
https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/16245

Given a dataset of plants, our objective was to build a neural network capable of achieving satisfying accuracy in classifying new images of plants as healthy or unhealthy, using the theory and methods we learned in classes and laboratories. \
We aim to discuss and illustrate techniques, challenges, and limitations we encountered in the development of the project and to get some insights on how neural network operate and how we could have better improved our model.
