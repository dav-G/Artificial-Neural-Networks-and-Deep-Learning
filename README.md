- [`ensemble_learning.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_1/ensemble_learning.ipynb) performs the Model Average Ensemble
- [`model.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_1/model.ipynb) builds the model, by performing fine-tuning and implementing the optimization techniques discussed in the report

- [`concatenate.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_2/concatenate.ipynb) concatenates the forecasters
- [`model.ipynb`](challenges/challenge_1/model.ipynb) builds the forecaster model, one for each category

## Challenges
In the challenges we have the opportunity to test what we learned during the course. \
They are hosted on the CodaLab platform (https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/).

## Challenge 1
Given a dataset of plants, our objective was to build a neural network capable of achieving satisfying accuracy in classifying new images of plants as healthy or unhealthy, using the theory and methods we learned in classes and laboratories. \
We aim to discuss and illustrate techniques, challenges, and limitations we encountered in the development of the project and to get some insights on how neural network operate and how we could have better improved our model.

## Challenge 2
The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequences to correctly predict the future. The task is to develop a forecasting model that is able to predict several uncorrelated time series. The prerequisite is that the model exhibits generalisation capabilities in the forecasting domain, allowing it to transcend the constraints of specific time domains. This requires a model that, while specialised in forecasting, is not limited to predicting in a single or predefined time context.
